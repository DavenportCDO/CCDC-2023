Game Plan:

First hour:

  Firewall team: 
    -Start checking for network config errors with ping/ipconfig/traceroute
    -Jump on the ubuntu machine and take a full backup of the firewall
    -shutdown / rebuild firewall once linux and windows teams have pulled down scripts
    
  Linux team:
    -pull down script from github
    -take backups of any scored service config file / encrypt the backups
    -run script while firewall team is initialising the firewall
    -turn on host firewalls and allow necessary services
    -start addressing issues found in script
    
  Windows team:
    -pull down scripts from github
    -take necessary backups
    -run scripts
    -fix issues found by script
